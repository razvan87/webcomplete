                <li><strong>Early life:</strong>
                    Born in Câmpulung-Muscel, Gyr was the son of actor Ștefan "Coco" Dumitrescu. When he was 3, his family moved to Craiova, where he did his secondary studies at the Carol I High School. Starting in 1924, he studied at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the University of Bucharest, where he received his Ph.D. in Literature and became a Senior Lecturer. He made his literary debut in 1924 with the well-received volume Liniști de schituri ("Silence of the sketes"),and continued with Cerbul de lumină (1928), Cununi uscate (1938), Poeme de război (1942), and Balade (1943).In 1927 he married Flora, with whom he had a daughter, Simona Luminița.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Iron Guard membership:</strong>
                    In the 1930s he published in right-wing, nationalist literary magazines such as Gândirea, Gând Românesc, Sfarmă-Piatră, Decembrie, Vremea, Revista Mea, and Revista Dobrogeană, and in the newspapers Cuvântul, Buna Vestire, and Cuvântul Studențesc. He joined the Iron Guard fascist movement, becoming in time its commander in the Oltenia region.When the Iron Guard was repressed by the regime of King Carol II, Gyr was arrested and imprisoned at Tismana.

                    After the National Legionary Government came to power in September 1940, he was appointed General Manager of the Romanian Theatres. Under his administration, the Barașeum Jewish Theater (later State Jewish Theater) was founded.The creation of the Jewish Theatre was accompanied by an interdiction against Jewish actors playing anywhere else in Romania, part of a joint effort to purge Jewish people from "Romanian" (non-Jewish) theatres across the country.
                </li>
                <li><strong>In prison:</strong>
                    Gyr was imprisoned for 20 years and he was never completely rehabilitated as a writer. In January 1941, after the Legionnaires' rebellion was put down by the Ion Antonescu regime, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, for inciting the crowd.[1] His first years as a political prisoner began as soon as the Iron Guard lost their battle with Antonescu. After spending time at Aiud Prison, Gyr was sent to fight on the Eastern Front (a form of punishment which was reserved for former Legionnaires) and was gravely wounded at the battle of Vinogradov. After the 1944 Romanian coup d'état he was re-arrested, and condemned to 12 years of hard labor for "contribution to the country's disaster". Sent back to Aiud, he was later transferred to Brașov Prison.

                    In 1959 he was sentenced to death by the Communist authorities because of his poem, considered subversive by the regime, "Ridică-te Gheorghe, ridică-te Ioane!" ("Arise Gheorghe, Arise Ioan!"). The poem called — in the style of a rally to war — the 'Romanian nation', symbolized by generic Romanian Christian names, to revolt. It had been issued as the last wave of brutal collectivization was taking hold of rural Romania (a process which lasted between 1949 and 1962).

                    Gyr was sent to Jilava Prison to wait for the ultimate penalty. He appealed the sentence, which was commuted to life imprisonment. He served only six years, two of which (at Aiud Prison) with chains at his feet. Although severely ill (hepatitis, tuberculosis, haemophilia, gangrened rectal prolapse), he was refused any medical assistance, was starved and tortured. Altogether he served 16 years in communist prisons (1945–1956; 1958–1964). In 1963–1964 all surviving political prisoners had to be released, upon pressure from the West.

                <li><strong>Death and legacy:</strong>
                    Gyr died in 1975 in Bucharest, and was buried in the city's Bellu Cemetery. In 2012, his remains and those of his wife (who died in 1984) were moved to Petru Vodă Monastery, in Poiana Teiului, Neamț County.

                    In 2010, a street in the Mănăștur district of Cluj-Napoca is named after him. In 2022, the USR party requested that the name of Radu Gyr Street be changed to Queen Helen Street. In 2025, the Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania renewed the request for a name change.

                    Ridică-te, Gheorghe, ridică-te, Ioane!

                    Nu pentru-o lopată de rumenă pâine,
                    nu pentru patule, nu pentru pogoane,
                    ci pentru văzduhul tău liber de mâine,
                    ridică-te, Gheorghe, ridică-te, Ioane!
                    
                    Pentru sângele neamului tău curs prin șanțuri,
                    pentru cântecul tău țintuit în piroane,
                    pentru lacrima soarelui tău pus în lanțuri,
                    ridică-te, Gheorghe, ridică-te, Ioane!
                    
                    Nu pentru mania scrâșnită-n măsele,
                    ci ca să aduni chiuind pe tapsane
                    o claie de zări și-o căciula de stele,
                    ridică-te, Gheorghe, ridică-te, Ioane!
                    
                    Așa, ca să bei libertatea din ciuturi
                    și-n ea să te-afunzi ca un cer în bulboane
                    și zărzării ei peste tine să-i scuturi,
                    ridică-te, Gheorghe, ridică-te, Ioane!
                    
                    Și ca să pui tot sărutul fierbinte
                    pe praguri, pe prispe, pe uși, pe icoane,
                    pe toate ce slobode-ți ies inainte,
                    ridică-te, Gheorghe, ridică-te, Ioane!
                    
                    Ridică-te, Gheorghe, pe lanțuri, pe funii!
                    Ridică-te, Ioane, pe sfinte ciolane!
                    Și sus, spre lumina din urmă-a furtunii,
                    ridică-te, Gheorghe, ridică-te, Ioane!
